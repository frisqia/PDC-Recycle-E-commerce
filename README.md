### Background

Waste is a serious issue that significantly impacts the environment and society. Some of the main problems caused by waste include:

- **Natural Disasters**: Accumulated waste can clog waterways, leading to floods and landslides.
- **Pollution**: Waste contaminates air, water, and soil, affecting environmental quality.
- **Health Risks**: Improper waste management can become a source of diseases.
- **Economic and Social Costs**: Waste leads to direct costs, such as cleanup, and indirect costs, like a reduced quality of life.

The primary factors contributing to waste issues include:

1. Lack of public awareness about proper waste disposal.
2. Limited government efforts in effective waste management.
3. Insufficient sorting of organic and inorganic waste.
4. Increased population mobility without matching waste management infrastructure.
